He assured me that I would know when it was time to take the next step. He was cautious to “not do any harm”
When I could no longer swim, I knew it was time. I booked the operation for March and then the pandemic happened. I patiently waited until July to go under the knife. The experience was remarkable. As Dr Taylor had promised, the operation was a non- event. With his skill, knowledge and focus, I never experienced any pain. I felt safe in his hands and perfectly at ease in HSS.

First, Dr. Daphne Scott (a superb non-surgical primary sports medicine physician) guided me through conservative treatment but the excellent imaging at HSS revealed rotator cuff surgery inevitable.  I dreaded the prospect, considered the many outstanding shoulder surgeons at HSS, and met with Dr. Sam Taylor — the Harvard-educated NY Giants team physician.  His reputation was stellar, and matched by compassion, empathy, and focus on my personal concerns and ambitions.  Surgery in Stamford, CT was a breeze, and convenient to my home to which I returned at mid-day.  That was five months ago.  My recovery has exceeded expectations in every way.  Pain is gone.

Dr. Goldstein was very professional and upfront about the operation. He even suggested I maybe try physical therapy first instead of going through with an operation, but I chose to go forward with the operation due to how much pain I was in.

Since my immobility and pain was quite obvious, Dr. Goldstein and his team were able to quickly find a surgery slot and things were all uphill from there.

Spinal fusion had been a surgery which frightened me above all others and to note, I had as a young man, survived brain surgery to resolve a growing cancer. This surgery was complex and had followed two prior surgeries over the past year to address the advancing osteoarthritis which stole the use of my hips from me, age 53. Over a decade of ever increasing narcotic use coupled to conservative modalities had ultimately failed. I never felt rushed, coerced nor any other feeling other than empathy while under this teams care both pre and post-operatively. The recovery was longer that I had anticipated and uncomfortable. I returned to work at 20 weeks. Now close to six months post-surgery, I am relatively pain free with the use of medication though my narcotic use is greatly reduced. I have lost over 50lbs of weight and continue my physical therapy at home and at a clinic 2x weekly. My only regret is not having found Dr Goldstein and team, earlier.",Rated 5 out of 5

My experience with Dr. Goldstein, and his team at NYU, was characterized by professionalism, patient education, accessibility, and technical success. I had been unable to sit down and was suffering from debilitating sciatic nerve pain. After examining me, Dr. Goldstein was able to perform surgery. His NP, Chelsea E Havelock answered all of my questions pre-op and post-op with detail, expertise, and care. The procedure was flawlessly executed and I was up and walking the same day, the results are amazing. The leg pain I had been experiencing was gone as soon as the surgery was completed. One month into the healing process, I continue to have no pain and feel only the most gratitude and respect for this team that has restored my health and quality of life. Would recommend it to anyone.",Rated 5 out of 5

I had to get a micro discectomy due to a severe disc herniation in my lumbar spine. He may be straight forward but he tells you exactly what needs to be done and executes it very precisely. I am only a few weeks post op but I feel like he gave me a new chance of life.

4463,"Dr. Redler is such a talented and caring surgeon. I ruptured both my patella tendons (one of the most devastating knee injuries, only in both knees at the same time) in 2018. Basically my legs were completely disabled. Dr. Redler compiled a team and repaired both ruptured patella tendons, using a new cutting edge procedure. People that have this injury don’t always comeback 100%. Within a couple of months I was basically back. Honestly my knees never felt better. Dr. Redler is an Alpha surgeon a driven, determined, and talented person. Don’t use the same old dudes that aren’t cutting edge. She is with you before, during, and after surgery. Don’t waste your time with other orthopedic surgeons!!!! She uses surgery as a last resort or to improve your life. In my case I had to regain the ability to walk, thanks to Dr. Redler I can run pain free.

4303,"BEST DOCTOR FOR SCAPHOID FRACTURES

From everything I heard about scaphoid - I went in to the appointment expecting to hear:

- Definite surgery (which I was okay with) knowing the extent my injury
- 12+ weeks of cast afterwards
- And even with that no certainty of injury

Now here I am less than 5 weeks after surgery. My CAT scan just came back showing a 90%+ healing of the bone and I do not need a splint anymore. On top of that, because I was not in a cast I have barely any stiffness in my hand. So less than 5 weeks after surgery (Dr. Polatsch originally said it would take 6 weeks to get to where I am at):

- Hardly any stiffness
- 90%+ healed fracture
- No splint or cast
- Almost unnoticeable scar (if any) from surgery 
- Getting back to my life! I should be back to 100% in no time!

Dr. Polatsch is simply the best and is literally CHANGING the algorithm on how to treat and heal scaphoid fractures. If you have one and are looking for the best - go no farther!",Rated 5 out of 5

I thank Dr Luis Grau for doing my full knee replacement surgery in January 2021. He is a great Doctor. He is a very caring Doctor, towards me, as well as all of his patients, just read his reviews.

4362,"I met Dr.Grau by chance and agreed to visit  him to check my left knee out that was bone on bone.
All it took was one visit for me to give up my other orthopedic surgeon who is a good doctor, but Dr. Grau has something extra, something very special about him something very human that only compliments his expertise as a top notch knee and hip specialist.
A hundred of my questions were answered with kindness and assurance, he guided and explained the whole process in layman’s terms and I went forward with such confidence that I felt this guy really cares!
After a successful robotic assisted total knee replacement surgery, that is so much less invasive than the conventional method , I was home the next day on the road to a complete and wonderful recovery!!

In fact, it was the worst he had ever seen. He accomodated me and quickly sceduled my surgury. The surgury was extremely successful. As soon as it was over I was walking with close to no pain with a walker.  By the time I was scheduled to go for my folllow-up visit, less than two weeks later I could walk pain free without a cane or walker.  It was incredible!

4179,"I am happy to finally thank you for a recommendation you offered to me in January, 2019. I was experiencing long-term hip pain for which surgery did not seem indicated (nor was it desired!), You recommended that I might start by trying an anti-inflammatory diet: strict abstinence from certain foods for 18 days and then, if desired, re-entering them one at a time and watching for any reaction.  The regimen was self-sustaining right from the beginning - I felt (and continue to feel!) lighter and brighter and years younger.  I am not rigid with this regimen and find that when I do try different foods, the response from my body is very clear and easy to read. I lost about 25 lbs. in the first 9 months and am at what I feel to be an appropriate weight, which has been maintained without effort for the year and 9 months that have followed (including over a year of “sheltering at home”).

The decision to do surgery and have Dr Rose do the procedure turned into one of the best decisions of my life. Dr Rose did a perfect job on my knee, as the procedure solved the problem, and I am now fully healed and back to full capability (which seemed like an improbable outcome before the surgery).

I put my confidence in Dr Bronson and his team and the surgery came off without a hitch.  Of course there was the usual pain expected immediately after the surgery, but I was fortunate in how soon I was able to get-up-and-get moving. 
In a few months, or a couple of years at the latest, I will need to get my other knee joint replaced, and as soon as Dr Bronson  says that it is ready, I won't hesitate at all and I will get it done.
It's great to be walking normally again!",Rated 5 out of 5

Dr. Chen was recommended to me by someone who worked at Sinai.  I will be forever grateful to her for doing so.  Dr. Chen is professional, caring, and a fine surgeon.  Within 6 weeks of the first surgery I had the 2nd hip done and within 4 weeks after that I was on my way to another state for a vacation.  I was a complicated case apparently but had no complications.  Stepping into Dr. Chen's office had a nostalgic feeling for me as I trained to become a nurse at Mt. Sinai, and the doctors' offices have been converted from the old student nurses residence.  Dr. Chen also comes with a well respected reputation...which is well earned.

301,"Dr. DiFelice is absolutely incredible. Ten days before my wedding day, I completely tore my chest. He got me into surgery as quickly as possible and made it so that I could dance with my beautiful wife on our wedding day. He showed caring and tremendous expertise. My chest was in two pieces and looked destroyed after my injury. There were other surgeons who said that my injury could not be fixed and that I would have to deal with a divot and a lack of power in my chest. Not only did he masterfully resculpt my chest but he repaired it so that the functionality is back to the way it was prior to injury. I am a former division 1 football player and working out is my main hobby. I care about the way my chest looks and functions and Dr. DiFelice made it so that I feel as good as ever.
One week after surgery, I was dancing with my wife on our wedding day.
One month after surgery, I was doing pushups.
Three months after surgery, I was back in the gym full force.

That surgeon in PA was ranked very highly but was terrible.

Quite simply, Dr DiFelice  is what an ideal surgeon should be - actually caring about you rather than running the meter, accessible and extremely competent.  

I tore my ACL in early 2012 (38 y old then) in a skiing accident. Came to him 4 months later and he tried what, at least at that time, only he was doing - reattaching the broken ACL as opposed to reconstructing one from another body part or a cadaver. He told me my c",Rated 5 out of 5

He was so patient & answered all my detailed questions, as I am a surgeon, too. He is a very thoughtful surgeon & has an excellent bedside manner. He was there for me on a Sunday afternoon when I had a problem that required revision surgery. He made sure to fix my problem after being in the office all day. He could have waited until the next day, but instead he put me first and operated until midnight. He came the next day to show me what he had done to fix the problem.

Due to the severity and complexity of my diagnosis I made a decision to research HSS and the qualifications of Dr. Huang. Once I made my decision to visit the HSS facility the process that proceeded was superior in every aspect. Their standards of treatment and care are beyond an explanation. My surgical procedure was mainly focused on L-5 and S-1 along with some additional surgical work in the lumbar area. It was a 6 hour procedure . My condition prior to the operation was miserable pain, loss of mobility and weakness. My body is pain free and I have regained normal mobility and quality of life. Dr. Huang is a gifted and warm surgeon. He has committed himself by perpetuating a personal surgeon/patient relationship since my day of surgery.

1480,"My mom (82 years old) had complete right hip replacement. The initial xrays showed that she basically had no socket and her leg was protruding into her lower chest cavity. Her right leg was over an inch shorter than her left due to this condition and it affected so many other things.
After the surgery my mom has had low level of pain if any as a result of the hip. Her right leg is now almost even with her left and her walk is less taxing with and no limp.
She can now sleep through the night since pain is not waking her up.
She used to require a walker before surgery. Now, 3.5 months after surgery, she rarely even uses a cane and only uses it when she goes outside in case of uneven surfaces.
Most importantly, Dr. Rossman goes out of his way to make a personal connection with the patient. For my mom, that was very important. She trusts him and admires his ability to communicate with an older (non-medically trained) person. ",Rated 5 out of 5

He was also upfront in telling me that it is common to find more damage once they get in, but they will repair those issues as well.  His office manager, Brandon Bascomb, is a super star.

1377,"Dr. Fu  is an extremely professional and compassionate doctor. Upon arrival in his office and meeting with him I realized his concern for my pain. After a fall down a spiral staircase the pain that I was experiencing was very severe. Dr. Fu explained to me in detail his plan for future surgery that was needed for my injury and diagnostic testing and the present concern for COVID-19. He  made me feel that I had made the right decision for him being my surgeon for this serious operation of a reverse shoulder replacement. I have had a very successful operation due to his expertise and his surgical abilities . I had previously seen another specialist at another hospital I know now that I had chosen the best hospital  at HSS and the best Orthopedic Surgeon
doctor for my surgery.  I highly recommend Dr. Michael Fu to my family and friends.",Rated 5 out of 5

I had advanced glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis of my right shoulder. After years of anti-inflammatory medication, cortisone injections, and sleepless nights, I felt it was time to explore shoulder surgery. Finding Dr. Michael Fu of HSS was a blessing. He explained why the stemless shoulder replacement would be my best option, detailed the recovery expectations, and answered my excessively long list of questions. The surgery went better than I anticipated. Seven months later, I’m playing golf, fishing, cycling and exercising. I haven’t felt this good in years!",Rated 5 out of 5

I was pleasantly surprised when Dr. Fu completely disagreed and immediately sent me for MRI and scheduled my surgery that same week. Dr. Fu and his staff, were always very helpful, kind and professional. I had the surgery and was back to work two weeks later, instead of the standard 8 weeks.
