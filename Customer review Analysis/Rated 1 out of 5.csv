4693,"Arrogant, dismissive and RUDE!  After 2 hours in his office, Dr. Sandhu spent about 10 minutes with me & told me that my back looked like a lot of others & he would not do surgery: “surgery on WHAT?”  As he was leaving he suggested I should get a more recent MRI. When I pointed out that I did have one & that it was right there on the screen in the examining room, he still did not look at it! He then suggested I see a neurologist & left. I have since had surgery and am now 98% pain-free. There are plenty of good doctors who will treat you respectfully- I suggest you forget this guy & find one of them!",Rated 1 out of 5

Other other surgeons told me I should’ve been told I wasn’t a candidate  The ADR device clearly did not fit and was not placed correctly. This is what I was told by other surgeons.  It was a total failure and had to be removed less then one year later. It introduced movement where I didn’t have any, caused the level about the fail. When it was removed, I then needed a two level fusion. The removal of it took half of two on my vertebrae’s with it. So after having the fusion ,the screws started coming out because there was no bone  to hold them in. So I then needed a posterior surgery and placement of more screws and rods.   That surgery was horrible. And now I’m looking at another surgery because the level above and below are failing when there was nothing wrong with them before.

You grossly minimized the risk and complexity of your recommended procedure, selling a minimally invasive procedure for a small partial thickness defect of my knee. What I received was a graft three times the size discussed. In addition you removed medial meniscus that I
I begged you prior to surgery not to touch.

You acted with full discretion, which you DID NOT HAVE!  As a result of your overly aggressive procedure, and unauthorized removal of meniscus, my knee is exceedingly worse. Now I am a prime candidate for a total knee replacement, which I was nowhere near prior to meeting you.

The treatment that I received and the way you sold the procedure was reckless and immoral. Clearly you've demonstrated you were more interested in a larger payday than in my outcome.

Today after a 2  month wait, I met with the doctor again.  When I told him about my difficulty in reaching him, he went on the offensive.  He told me he has PAs to do that and that I was changing my complaints all the time (Not true at all!)  I think his PAs are lovely, but they are still only PAs.

The doctor did repair on 4 cervical discs and 3 lumbar discs During my 5 days in the hospital I was never aware of being visited by the doctor.
Approximately 6 weeks later during an office visit I was informed that there were 3 additional discs that needed repair . I asked him why he did not do the discs at the time of surgery.
His direct quote was,'if I did it I would have killed you"".
He then told me that even though he has done this type of procedure many times there was nothing he could for me.

3860,"Absolutely awful experience.  It was quite a few years ago.  My dad had had Dr. Stuchin do his hip replacement which Dr. Stuchin is known for. Unfortunately, my surgery was not one he is known for. It was an elbow surgery done to restore/increase mobility.  Critical to the recovery process is immediate use right after surgery of an Elbow CPM Machine (I think that's what it was called).  It had been delivered to the Hospital for Joint Diseases but neither the supervising nurse nor the resident knew how exactly to set me up in it. 

Even after months of PT there was no improvement.  Dr. Stuchin, in fact, maintained from the get-go that the surgery was a success and that it was just my 'mind' that was prohibiting movement.  I'm a smart fellow but I don't give my mind THAT much credit. It was his job to make sure that the after-care that was critical to the success of the surgery went as it should.

Hospital for Special Surgery has ruined my life. Her carelessness has left me struggling to get my life back. My (Patellofemoral replacements with her are an embarrassment to the orthopedic industry.She continuously told me I needed pain management and therapy as my condition progressively got worse.  She measured my tibial tubercles wrong  both legs. The right she measured 10 mm which is within normal range but it was 20 mm and the left tubercle she measured 6.5mm which is deviation from the normal range and it was 17mm. Her failure to measure me properly has caused me all kinds of complications.  Other surgeons are in shock and trying to clean up her mess. When a surgeon looks at your xray and says ""I wonder why she didn't measure that before she cemented it"" you know it's bad. I had 4 corrective surgeries If it doesnt work its bilateral knee replacements for me because of her surgical errors.

 In 2019 she reconstructed my MPFL, performed a lateral release (this was not part of the pre-surgical plan), and cartilage debridement. The results of this surgery were devastating. Instead of stabilizing my patella her surgery made me unable to return to every day activities such as walking(5+mins). I started having medial (inside) subluxations of my patella, which damaged my cartilage. Medial subluxations only happen after detrimental surgical interventions. She had made my new MPFL too tight by 50%!!  and destabilized my patella with the lateral release. She dismissed my concerns in my follow up appointments and did not even look at my chart to review the type of surgery she had performed! Her nurse and I had to remind her.

 I just had another surgery (with a different surgeon of course!) to fix her errors but have lost two years of my life, career as a professional dancer, and thousands of dollars. 

I wish someone had warned me. Please choose a different surgeon!!
